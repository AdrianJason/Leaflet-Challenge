# Leaflet-Challenge
This project is a visualization of earthquake data from USGS that occurred between January 1st and January 2nd, 2021. The visualization is created using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, and D3.js, a JavaScript library for data visualization.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in a web browser to view the visualization.
Usage
The visualization displays the locations and magnitudes of earthquakes that occurred during the specified time frame. The circles on the map represent the earthquakes, and the size of the circle represents the magnitude of the earthquake. The color of the circle represents the depth of the earthquake, with warmer colors indicating shallower depths and cooler colors indicating deeper depths. Clicking on a circle will display a popup with information about the earthquake.
